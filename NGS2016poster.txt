Conclusion

Falling costs of genetic sequencing allows non-model organism sequencing, then annotation. In annotating non-model genomes, mRNA-seq data has great potential to improve annotation quality. For example the Asian sea bass (L. calcarifer) genome annotation effort drew on previously assembled mRNA-seq data provided by the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL). At SANBI we undertook gene annotation on the Asian seabass genome using a pipeline built out of custom
scripts. Simultaneously, a team at Saint Petersburg State University undertook the same
task using MAKER2. Comparing the results of this annotation highlighted the impact of tool and parameter choice in gene prediction.

Starting from the mRNA-seq data generated by the team at Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL)
and using the Galaxy platform, we constructed two workflows, one starting from assembled
transcripts and mapping these to the genome using BLAST+ and Exonerate, the other using RNA STAR and Cufflinks. We compared the exons and transcripts predicted by these pipelines and show
that XX% of the exons boundaries predicted overlapped, although the RNA STAR and Cufflinks pipeline was much faster. Using Galaxy allowed us to rapidly compose novel workflows and,
using IPython notebooks embedded within Galaxy, analyse their results. We continue to develop
our workflows in order to produce a complete genome annotation workbench based on the
Galaxy platform.
